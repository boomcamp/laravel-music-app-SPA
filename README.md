# Introduction

For your remaining 2 weeks in PHP course using `laravel framework` you need to develop a SPA(Single Page Application) called `Music Library`.

### Entities

We should have a database name called `music` with various relationships e.g `Users, Artist, Albums, Songs etc`.

### Specifications

* Laravel frontend (you can select your ui framework React or VueJS).

* A `Login/Logout` and `Registration`.

* A `Create`, `Read`, `Update` and `Delete` functionality.

* An access token for our api endpoints (you can select your authentication system e.g Sanctum or [Passport]( https://www.itsolutionstuff.com/post/laravel-6-rest-api-with-passport-tutorialexample.html)).

* A navigation guard that authenticates the frontend routes.

* Laravel ORM relationships.

* A [data services](https://bezkoder.com/vue-js-crud-app/) that connects to our api.
